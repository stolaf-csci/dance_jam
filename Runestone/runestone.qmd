For this course, we will be using an online interactive textbook called _Foundations of Python Programming_, which is available through a platform called Runestone Academy. These instructions will walk you through the process of setting up an account, using the textbook, and accessing reading assignments.

# **Creating a Runestone Account**

# **Accessing Reading Assignments**

To access assignments:

1. Log into Runestone.
2. Click the person icon (top right), then choose **Assignments**:

You’ll see a list like this (not all assignments will appear at once):

![Assignment list](images/ra2.png)

Click on the assignment you want. For example:

![Assignment example](images/ra3.png)

Each assignment has multiple pages. To begin, click the first link (e.g., “General Introduction/1.1 Introduction: The Way of the Program”). This will take you to a reading page:

![Reading page](images/ra4.png)

Read the page, watch videos, complete exercises. When done, you'll see a green “Completed. Well Done!” message. For text-only pages, click **Mark as Completed**.

Navigate using **Continue to page ...** to follow the assignment sequence.

Some pages include interactive exercises:

Try to complete these to the best of your ability. There’s no limit on attempts. You don't need perfect answers, but you must make a serious effort. Ask for help if needed.

Return to the assignment landing page to track progress. Green check marks indicate pages you’ve completed. Use the **Compute Score for Assignment** button to update your progress.

You can also use the **In Progress** and **Finished** buttons to help track your status:

![Progress tools](images/ra6.png)  
![More progress tracking](images/ra7.png)

These buttons are just for you—grading is based on actual activity before the due date.

After clicking **Compute Score**, your completion % will update. Individual sections also show scores:

# ⚠ Note:
Some textbook sections are still being developed. Occasionally, a completed section may not be recorded. As explained in the syllabus, assignments are graded on a **2-point scale**, and anything **>80% completion** will receive full credit.
