Provides information on algorithms along with resources for animation.

Example of Bubble Sort animation <br>
![manim video of bubble sort](files/BubbleSort.mp4) <br>
The purpose of the video is to sort the bars from shortest to longest. 
The algorithm starts at the beginning and checks each bar with it's neighbor by outlining in orange. 
If the bars are not in the correct order, the bars swap spots. 
Otherwise, it moves to the next set of neighbors.
This continues until every bar is in the correct order and correct position.

There are a plethora of resources out there to visualize sorting algorithms. Here is another [example](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting).
