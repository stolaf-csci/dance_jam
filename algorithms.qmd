Example of Bubble Sort animation <br>
![manim video of bubble sort](files/BubbleSort.mp4) <br>
The purpose of the video is to sort the bars from shortest to longest. 
The algorithm starts at the beginning and checks each bar with it's neighbor by outlining in orange. 
If the bars are not in the correct order, the bars swap spots. 
Otherwise, it moves to the next set of neighbors.
Eventually if the bar is in it's correct position, it will be outlined in bright green.
This continues until every bar is in the correct order and correct position.
