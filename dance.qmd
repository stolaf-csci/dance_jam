# Bulgarian Kopanitsa

The **Kopanitsa** is one of the most energetic and technically demanding folk dances from the Shop (Shope) region of western Bulgaria. Its name is derived from the Bulgarian word *kopanye*, which means "**digging**," reflecting the sharp, downward-driving footwork that mimics the rhythmic striking of the earth.

What truly sets the Kopanitsa apart is its complex **asymmetrical meter** as it is typically performed in **11/16 time**. This rhythm is subdivided into five beats:
`quick–quick–slow–quick–quick` or  `2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2`.

## Key Features of the Dance

- **The Grip:**  
  Dancers usually hold each other by the belt (*na lesa*) or join hands in a V position, forming a fast-moving line or circle.

- **The Movement:**  
  Characterized by intricate "knitting" steps, high knee lifts, and sudden squats.

- **The Vibe:**  
  A display of strength and agility. While traditionally emphasizing masculine prowess, it is now performed by all genders and often reaches a frenetic pace as the music accelerates.

## Rhythm and Musical Structure

The Kopanitsa is played in an **11/16 time signature**. Because the middle beat is slightly longer than the others, it can feel like a **lopsided heartbeat**.

Dancers think of it as **five counts**, giving the *third* count extra weight. As we saw before, this can be written like
`1 – 2 – [3] – 4 – 5` or `short – short – LONG – short – short`

## Historical and Social Context

Kopanitsa is a **social dance** performed today at weddings, festivals, and on large international stages. Historically, it is more than just a dance—it is a vital expression of national identity and the rebellious spirit of the Bulgarian people, particularly the Shopi highlanders.

During the long period of Ottoman rule (1396–1878), when many forms of cultural expression were restricted, communal dances in the village square became a "censorship-free" space where Bulgarians could maintain their language, faith, and unity. Socially, the dance served as the heartbeat of village life, performed at Sunday gatherings (*horo*), weddings, and festivals.

Because Kopanitsa is a **“called” dance** (where a leader shouts out changes), it historically served as a test of community coordination and personal stamina. In the rugged Shopluk region, the aggressive "digging" steps and accelerating tempo became a way to display humor, resilience, and masculine prowess. While it was traditionally often gender-segregated, today it is a **unifying force**, bringing people of all ages together in a single fast-moving line.

## Floor Patterns

Kopanitsa is traditionally danced in a **long line** of dancers connected by a belt hold, with each dancer holding the belts of the dancers on either side. This creates a strong sense of **community and cohesion**.

- The dance progresses **to the right**, with rightward movements traveling slightly more than those moving left.
- In social settings, dancers form an **open circle** moving around the space.
- In performance settings, dancers move more freely, creating **lines, circles, or other choreographic figures**.

Steps can be combined into more complex patterns or sequences, like **Lego pieces** that can be assembled, taken apart, and rebuilt in different ways.

- **The “Dig”**: On the 3rd (long) beat, really sink into the step—this is where the “digging” name comes from.

- **Posture**: Keep your upper body tall and proud while your legs do the heavy lifting.

- **Speed**: Start slow. Traditionally, the music begins at a manageable pace and ends in a **blur of feet**.
