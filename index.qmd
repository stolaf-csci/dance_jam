# Where Algorithms Meet Artistry

Dancers and coders will team up to create **a choreographed algorithm**.

_“Choreographed what??”_  
You heard us!

Inspired by the folk‑dance videos produced at Sapientia University in Transylvania (Romania), where traditional Hungarian, Romanian and Saxon folk‑dance styles were used to illustrate sorting algorithms like [bubble‑sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4) and [select-sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns4TPTC8whw). 

Our jam invites students to create their own original choregoraphy using traditional Bulgarian dance steps to embody either the structure, logic and/or flow of a chosen algorithm.

## How It Works

### The Weekend Jam: Kickoff & Creation
Cross‑disciplinary teams of dancers and programmers come together to select, understand, and choreograph an algorithm. 
Each group will select an algorithm, either of their own choice or from the selection found under the Algorithms tab. 
Then we'll have each party describe the techiniques being used: dancers will showcase the basic movement "blocks" of the Bulgarian dance, and programmers will break down the logic behind the algorithm of choice. 
Next comes the fun part! Coders and dancer will collaborate side‑by‑side, mapping the algorithm's logic to the nuanced movement and rhythm, exploring how various steps of a given algorithm might translate into the physical space that a dance occupies.

### Refinement & Rehearsal
Teams will meet up asynchronously to debug their movement logic, strengthening structure and clarifying concepts 
through rehearsal, feedback and iteration. As in programming, you’ll test, revise and polish until the routine 
becomes and algorithm come to life through dance. 

### Showcase Event
The culmination of months of creative synergy, where each group will have their choreography performed live. 
For an additional "techy" flair, programmers can also design animations or graphics to go along with the dancers movements.

## Why Participate?

The Dance Jam is an immersive experience that breaks down silos between disciplines. Whether you’re a dancer curious about algorithms or this jam is your chance to collaborate, experiment and build something completely unexpected. Break down barriers between disciplines.
