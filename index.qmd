*Course Description*: This course introduces the perspectives and methods of computer science. Students learn to develop algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures for accomplishing a task. Students
translate these algorithms into a programming language, utilizing common programming structures. The
structures covered include variables, functions, loops, control flow, basic data structures, classes, and a brief
introduction to object-oriented programming.

*Course Objectives*:
- To understand key concepts and abstractions involved in programming.
- To be able to write simple computer programs.
- To better understand how computers work.
- To develop knowledge and skills that will allow the student to use computers to solve novel problems
throughout life.
