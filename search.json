    "text": "Dancers and coders will team up to create a choreographed algorithm.\n“Choreographed what??”\nYou heard us!\nInspired by the folk‑dance videos produced at Sapientia University in Transylvania (Romania), where traditional Hungarian, Romanian and Saxon folk‑dance styles were used to illustrate sorting algorithms like bubble‑sort and select-sort. Our jam invites students to create their own original dance that embodies the structure, logic and flow of a chosen algorithm.\nThis event is all about creativity, collaboration, and iteration\n\n\n\n\nCross‑disciplinary teams of dancers and programmers come together to concept and choreograph an algorithm. The goal: to choreograph an algorithm that expresses a computational idea or solves a problem through movement. Coders and dancers collaborate side‑by‑side, mapping code logic to movement and rhythm, exploring how loops, swaps, partitions or recursion might translate into steps, patterns and formations.\n\n\n\nTeams return for a focused weekend of debugging their movement logic, strengthening structure and clarifying concepts through rehearsal, feedback and iteration. As in programming, you’ll test, revise and polish until the routine becomes and algorithm come to life through dance.\n\n\n\nThe culmination of months of creative synergy, where each group performs their dance algorithm live. Celebrate the fusion of STEM and art, innovation and expression, logic and emotion.\n\n\n\n\nThe Dance Jam is an immersive experience that breaks down silos between disciplines. Whether you’re a dancer curious about algorithms or this jam is your chance to collaborate, experiment and build something completely unexpected. Break down barriers between disciplines. Go to registration to save your spot!",
